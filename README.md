# cypress_cucumber_testing
Welcome to the cypress_cucumber_testing repository! This project is dedicated to implementing test techniques, ensuring quality, and practicing the use of JavaScript, Cypress, and Cucumber.
# Purpose
The main objectives of this repository are:
- Implementing test techniques: Explore and apply various testing methodologies to ensure the reliability and stability of software applications.
- Assuring quality: Implement testing strategies to identify and address defects early in the development process, ultimately improving the overall quality of the software.
- Practicing JavaScript, Cypress, and Cucumber: Gain hands-on experience with JavaScript as the primary programming language, Cypress as the end-to-end testing framework, and Cucumber for behavior-driven development (BDD).
